object
    parametric surfaces
        wireframe
    save nonexploding position and rotation information
        (save rotation / translation matrices instead of lambdas)
    make density individual attribute

discretizer
    planes & other parametric -- find bounds based on transform & perspective

render
    viewpoint rotate

    arbitrary time dim

simulator


REFACTORING
clean up simulate
    simulate methods use render video method


BUGS

wavelengths arent correct?
images also flipped 90 degrees?
videos switch red/blue and rotated 90 degrees
harmonic wavelength is half wavelength
