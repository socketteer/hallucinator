function to modify existing surface/path object with
    moving, or
    unmoving disturbance

scene types:
    full color (x, y, z, (R, G, B))

group/paraobject
    make density individual attribute
    autonaming
    transformations
        mirroring
        projection
            pinhole

scene
    RGB scene
    autonaming
    project all
    viewpoint (coordinate system) translate, rotate

object
    go through everything and make sure it all follows one convention
    ellipses
    rectangle
    convert 2d to flat 3d
    3d sphere
        constructed from circles?
        parametric surface (in polar coordinates?)
    parametric surfaces
        wireframe
    change vectors to use transforms instead of lambdas?
    vertices w adjacency

discretizer
    planes & other parametric -- find bounds based on transform & perspective
    clipping

optics
    ray
        shadows
        brightness
        functional lenses, mirrors
    wave source(s) + surface
    symbols


BUGS

clipping
wavelengths arent correct?
images also flipped 90 degrees?
videos switch red/blue and rotated 90 degrees
video dimensions error unless square?
