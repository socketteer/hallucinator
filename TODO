    moving, or
    unmoving disturbance

3d diffeq fields
diffeq translation methods / class

scene types:
    full color (x, y, z, (R, G, B))

group/paraobject
    make density individual attribute
    make density variable
    autonaming
    transformations
        mirroring
        projection
            pinhole

scene
    RGB scene
    autonaming

object
    go through everything and make sure it all follows one convention
    ellipses
    solid shapes and surfaces
    rectangle, circle etc in 3d
    convert 2d to flat 3d
    change vectors to use transforms instead of lambdas?
    vertices w adjacency

discretizer
    planes & other parametric -- find bounds based on transform & perspective
    clipping


actual wireframe

optics
    ray
        shadows
        brightness
        functional lenses, mirrors
    wave source(s) + surface
    symbols


BUGS

wavelengths arent correct?
images also flipped 90 degrees?
videos switch red/blue and rotated 90 degrees
video dimensions error unless square?
