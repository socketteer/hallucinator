integrate wave into object system
scene types:
    monochromatic (x, y, z)
    grayscale (x, y, z, {0,1})
    full color (x, y, z, (R, G, B))

group/paraobject
    make density individual attribute
    autonaming
    projection
        weak
        other

scene
    autonaming
    viewpoint (coordinate system) rotate

object
    ellipses
    convert 2d to 3d
    3d sphere
        constructed from circlse?
        parametric surface (in polar coordinates?)
    parametric surfaces
        wireframe
    change vectors to use transforms instead of lambdas?
    vertices w adjacency

discretizer
    planes & other parametric -- find bounds based on transform & perspective

render
    advanced projection
    functional color

optics
    ray
        shadows
        brightness
        functional lenses, mirrors
    wave source(s) + surface
    symbols

time dim
    arbitrary time dim


REFACTORING
clean up simulate
    simulate methods use render video method


BUGS

wavelengths arent correct?
images also flipped 90 degrees?
videos switch red/blue and rotated 90 degrees
harmonic wavelength is half wavelength
video dimensions error unless square?
