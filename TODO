Features
    Contour maps for parabolas (fourier, fresnel), circles, ellipse. Compare to zone plates

Code
    Improve argument specification for perspective code
    Profile perspective code

Explore
    Opencv keyboard interaction for zone plate scene exploration? (or is matplotlib enough?) Change xy plane range?

    Helper function for stacking and displaying images?

Display
    Helper function for interpolation video, filenames?
    Non-square videos
    Parameters on first frame of video?
